# Antivirus Demo

Overview
============
This project helps train a classifier to detect [PE files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) as either malicious or legitimate. It tries out 6 different classification algorithms before deciding which one to use for prediction by comparing their results.

Dependencies
============

* pandas ```pip install pandas```
* numpy ```pip install numpy```
* pickle ```pip install pickle```
* scipy ```pip install scipy```
* scikit ```pip install -U scikit-learn```

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Basic Usage
===========

1. Run ```python learning.py``` to train the model. It will train on the dataset included called 'data.csv'.

2. Once trained you can test the model via ```python checkpe.py YOUR_PE_FILE```. It will output either malicious or legitimate!

# Advanced Usage  

To further analyze and detect malware in various file types such as PDF, DOCX, and image files, use the analyze_files.py script:

```python analyze_files.py <PATH_TO_FILE>```

# Algorithms and Features

The project employs the following machine learning supervised models for malware detection:

* Decision Tree

* Random Forest

* Naive Bayes

* Gradient Boosting

* AdaBoosting

Each algorithm is evaluated to determine the best-performing model for accurate prediction.

# Using Flask for Frontend 

This Flask web application allows users to register, log in, create, view, and delete notes. It uses SQLAlchemy for database management, Flask-Login for session management, and Flask-Bcrypt for secure password hashing.

Data Flow and File Functions
main.py: The entry point for initialising and running the Flask app.

_init_.py: Sets up the Flask app configuration, initializes the database, registers blueprints for routing, and configures user authentication.

auth.py: Manages user authentication.

/login: Verifies user credentials and logs in to the user.
/logout: Logs out the user.
/sign-up: Handles user registration and creates new user accounts.

models.py: Defines database models.
User: Stores user information.
Note: Stores user-created notes.

views.py: Manages main application routes.

/ (home): Displays the user's notes and allows new notes to be added.
/delete-note: Handles deletion of notes.
HTML Templates
base.html: The main layout template.
home.html: Displays user notes and provides a form for adding new notes.
login.html: User login page.
sign_up.html: User registration page.
